\b;Alludo

Basic user level made for level designers, developers and testers.

\t;Features

* The whole map is flat and there is no water.
* Underground resources location is indicated by ground spots in the three corners of the map.
* 1 grid == 1 square "colometer"
* `Me` and first bots are immortal.
* All buildings and bots are available.
* There is no living alien to disturb you.
* All objects available in the game are situated in the south-east corner of the map.
* Mission never ends.
* A ramp showing every possible height of the ground.

\t;Examples

* Ground texture

You can change the ground texture by modifying the \c;levels/custom/alludo/level001/terra001.bmp\n; file in the folder where you installed the level. This file must be saved as \c;bmp\n; (24-bit bitmap). You should just save it without changing the format, if your graphics editor has that option.

* Relief

The ramp is in a relief file. Each pixel represents one height. The ramp is 3 pixels wide.
