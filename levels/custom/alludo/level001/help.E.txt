\t;Examples

o Ground texture

You can change the ground texture by modifying the \c;levels/custom/alludo/level001/terra001.bmp\n; file in the folder where you installed the level. This file must be saved as \c;bmp\n; (24-bit bitmap). You should just save it without changing the format, if your graphics editor has that option.

The ramp is in a relief file. Each pixel represents one height. The ramp is 3 pixels wide.
